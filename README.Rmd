[REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/) is a powerful database solution used by many research institutions:

> "REDCap is a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases. While REDCap can be used to collect virtually any type of data in any environment (including compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, FISMA, HIPAA, and GDPR), it is specifically geared to support online and offline data capture for research studies and operations."

The goal of `REDCapTidieR` is to provide users with a simple API for extracting REDCap databases and turning them into tidy `tibble`s. This makes for easily joinable tables with only the data necessary for specific REDCap forms, instead of the singular complex table typically received from a single export.

`REDCapTidieR` will be of great use to any databases using:

- Repeating Instruments
- Longitudinal Events
- Longitudinal Arms

`REDCapTidieR` is meant to be used in conjunction with the [`REDCapR`](https://ouhscbbmc.github.io/REDCapR/) package. It is built to be reliant on data extraction from underlying functions including `redcap_read_oneshot()`, `redcap_metadata_read()`, and `redcap_event_instruments()`. You may have even noticed the name for this package is just a "tidy"-fied addition to `REDCapR`! Therefore, we owe much credit and acknowledgement to the developers of `REDCapR`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `REDCapTidieR` like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("CHOP-CGTDataOps/REDCapTidieR")
```

## Examples

### Exporting REDCap Databases to Tidy `tibbles`

Using the main function is simple and only requires a REDCap URI and an API token with read/write privileges:

```r
redcap_export <- read_redcap_tidy(redcap_uri, token)
```

Where a sample output containing repeating instruments may look like:

```r
redcap_export
```

```bash
# A tibble: 3 × 3
  redcap_form_name redcap_data  structure   
  <chr>            <list>       <chr>       
1 repeated         <df [9 × 6]> repeating   
2 nonrepeated      <df [8 × 5]> nonrepeating
3 nonrepeated2     <df [3 × 5]> nonrepeating
```

Where the contents of `redcap_data` contain only the data associated with the form:

```r
redcap_export$redcap_data %>% pluck(1)
```

```bash
  record_id redcap_repeat_instance redcap_event redcap_arm repeat_1 repeat_2
1         1                      1      event_1          1        1        2
2         1                      2      event_1          1        3        4
3         1                      3      event_1          1        5        6
4         1                      1      event_2          1        A        B
5         1                      2      event_2          1        C        D
6         3                      1      event_1          1        C        D
7         3                      1      event_2          1        E        F
8         3                      2      event_2          1        G        H
9         4                      1      event_3          2       R1       R2
```

### Loading Tidy `tibbles` to Specified Environments

As an additional feature to `REDCapTidieR`, the `bind_tables()` function serves to allow users to assign the tidy data tables under `$redcap_data` to loaded data elements in a specified environment.

By default, when using `bind_tables()` all elements will load as individual dataframes into the global environment. Users have the option to specify a different environment object to assign dataframes to, as well as specify specific `redcap_form_name`s and `structure`s if the they do not wish to load all data elements.

**Load all elements to global environment:**
```r
read_redcap_tidy(redcap_uri, token) %>% 
  bind_tables()
```

**Load selected elements to specified environment:**
```r
sample_environment = rlang::new_environment()

read_redcap_tidy(redcap_uri, token) %>% 
  bind_tables(environment = sample_environment, 
              redcap_form_name = c("nonrepeated", "repeated"))
```
