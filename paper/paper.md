# Summary

Capturing and storing electronic data is of utmost importance in the research world, yet often becomes a burden to the researchers themselves. [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/) [@Harris2009; @Harris2019] alleviates this problem by offering a secure web application that lets users build databases and surveys with a robust and convenient front-end interface that can support data of any type, including data requiring compliance with standards for protected information. To get a sense of its scope and impact, as of 2023 the REDCap Consortium has almost 3 million users spanning over 150 countries.

For many researchers who use REDCap, the R language is a powerful tool for extracting and analyzing their data. To take advantage of REDCap's REST API, the [`REDCapR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/REDCapR/index.html) and [`redcapAPI`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/redcapAPI/index.html) packages allow R users to extract data directly into their programming environment. The default extraction structure for a given REDCap database is referred to as the "Block Matrix," and is a singular, unwieldy, and "untidy" data table. The concept of "[tidy data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10)" [@Wickham2014] describes a framework for standard mapping and structuring of data where each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table. Fundamentally, the Block Matrix breaks these tidy principles by obscuring the primary keys that identify individual records, leaving researchers and analysts with the arduous task of reformatting the matrix into something more readable.

To address these challenges, we developed `REDCapTidieR` as an open source R package [@r_citation] that transforms the standard REDCap output into a format that adheres to tidy data principles. `REDCapTidieR` has the potential to save organizations and research staff immeasurable amounts of time, allowing them to swiftly begin querying their data without the need for intricate data parsing processes.

# Installation

`REDCapTidieR` is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/CHOP-CGTInformatics/REDCapTidieR) and [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/REDCapTidieR/index.html) and has been tested for functionality on all major operating systems.

# Conflict of interest

This package was developed by the [Childrenâ€™s Hospital of
Philadelphia](https://www.chop.edu) Cell and Gene Therapy Informatics
Team to support the needs of the [Cellular Therapy and Transplant
Section](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/cellular-therapy-and-transplant-section).
The development was funded using the following sources:
